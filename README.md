# Python-Keylogger
# Disclaimer: This is the script part of my python project:FOR PART 2 CHECK Django-Web-Server-for-Keylogger Repo 

This is a keylogger script made in python that sends data to a server.The script captures the keys with a listner, puts them in a file created with a random name in one of two randmly chosen locations and after it sends data to the server the file is deleted. If CTRL+C and CTRL+V is used the clipboard is copied in the file.
